# pongPy
    simple pong game made in Python3

    IT WILL NOT WORK ON OTHER OS THAN WINDOWS!!
        thats because I had to use the winsound library to play asynchronous sfx

    python requirement >= 3.10
        in this code i use the new "match" feature of python3.10
        this is similar to switch on C
        idk why this wasnt implemented before

    required libraries
        run on cmd "pip install -r requirements.txt"

    other requirements
        looks like tkinter cant import a font by path
        so if you wanna see the score numbers correctly,
        you must install "AtariSmall.ttf"
        it is on "%YOURINSTALLEDPATH%\pongPy\font"

    to run the game
        assuming your cd is "%YOURINSTALLEDPATH%\pongPy"
        run on cmd "python - u "pongPy\main\main.py"

    to close the game
        you can simply click the "x" on top-right
        or press Esc key at any time

    third party contents
        the sounds present at "sounds" folder
        and the font present at "font" folder
        arent of my authoring
        you can check links to the authors at
        "font\credits.txt" and
        "sounds\credits.txt"
