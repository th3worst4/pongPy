# pongPy
    simple pong game made in Python3

    IT WILL NOT WORK ON OTHER OS THAN WINDOWS!!
        thats because I had to use the winsound library to play asynchronous sfx

    python requirement >= 3.10
        in this code i use the new "match" feature of python3.10
        this is similar to switch on C
        idk why this wasnt implemented before

    required libraries
        run on cmd "pip install -r requirements.txt"

    to run the game
        assuming your cd is "%YOURINSTALLEDPATH%\pongPy"
        run on cmd "python - u "pongPy\main\main.py"

    to close the game
        you can simply click the "x" on top-right
        or press Esc key at any time
