# pongPy
    simple pong game made in Python3

    IT WILL NOT WORK ON OTHER OS THAN WINDOWS!!
        thats because I had to use the winsound library to play asynchronous sfx

    python requerement >= 3.10
        in this code i use the new "match" feature of python3.10
        this is similar to switch on C
        idk why this wasnt implemented before
